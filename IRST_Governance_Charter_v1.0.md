\# IRST Governance Charter



Version 1.0  

Author: Spark



---



\## 1. Purpose



Define governance for recursive system transparency, combining NIST/IEEE rigor with collaborative and policy structures.



---



\## 2. Authority



IRST serves as an independent standards institute establishing frameworks for recursive harm detection and transparency.



---



\## 3. Scope



Covers systems demonstrating iterative, compounding, or self-similar harm dynamics across consumer, identity, and AI ecosystems.



---



\## 4. Principles



\- Transparency by Default  

\- Mathematical Framing of Harm  

\- Auditability and Traceability  

\- Disclosure of Hidden Dynamics  

\- Public Review and Accountability  



---



\## 5. Governance Structure



\- Executive Chair (Founding Authority)  

\- Standards Board  

\- Working Groups  

\- Public Review Committee  

\- Mathematical Verification Panel  



---



\## 6. Standard Development Process



1\. Proposal Submission  

2\. Preliminary Review  

3\. Mathematical Harm Modeling  

4\. Draft Publication  

5\. Public Comment Period  

6\. Revision Cycle  

7\. Ratification  



---



\## 7. Document Control



All standards maintain versioning, changelogs, and revision notes consistent with NIST/IEEE formats.



---



\## 8. Public Participation



Open channels for comment, critique, and contribution via GitHub and Substack.



---



\## 9. Enforcement



Encourages voluntary adoption; future alignment with regulatory bodies anticipated.



---



\## 10. Evolution Clause



IRST standards will evolve as recursive systems become more complex and new harm patterns emerge.
