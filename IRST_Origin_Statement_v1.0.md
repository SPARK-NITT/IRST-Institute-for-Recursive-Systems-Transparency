\# IRST Founding Origin Statement



IRST wasn’t created in a boardroom.



It came from real frustration — the kind you only feel after buying hardware marketed one way, behaving another, and relying on cloud systems it swore it didn’t need.



Add in the upsell pressure for faster delivery, the hidden limitations, and the recursive support loops…



and suddenly the problem wasn’t the device.



It was the system.



IRST is the answer to that moment — a way to expose these loops before they consume another person’s time and wallet.
