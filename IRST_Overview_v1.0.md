## ABOUT IRST

The Institute for Recursive Systems Transparency (IRST) develops standards that govern systems exhibiting recursive, iterative, or compounding behavior that affects human beings.

These include:

- consumer ecosystems that trap users in loops  
- digital identity systems that compound harm over time  
- AI recommendation and ranking systems  
- IoT and cloud-dependent devices that behave differently than advertised

## MISSION

To expose hidden loops, compounding effects, and structural opacity through mathematically grounded governance standards.

## CURRENT STANDARDS

- NITT — No-Identity Teleport Theorem  
- CTGS — Consumer Transparency Governance Standard

## PRINCIPLES

1. Transparency by Default  
2. Mathematical Framing of Harm  
3. Disclosure of Hidden Dynamics  
4. Auditability and Traceability  
5. Systems Must Not Exploit Recursive Loops
