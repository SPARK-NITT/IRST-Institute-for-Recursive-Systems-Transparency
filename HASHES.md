\# IRST — HASHES



This file records SHA-256 hashes for canonical IRST repository documents.



Hashes MUST be generated locally (e.g., using `scripts/hash\_utils.py`) only AFTER:

\- the README for a given release is finalized, and

\- all canonical documents for that release are in their final form.



Do NOT edit or “clean up” old hash batches. Append new batches.



---



\## Canonical targets (per release)



At minimum, each release SHOULD hash:



\- `README.md`

\- `docs/IRST\_Overview\_v1.0.md`

\- `docs/IRST\_Origin\_Statement\_v1.0.md`

\- `docs/IRST\_Governance\_Charter\_v1.1.md`

\- `docs/IRST\_Operational\_Enforcement\_v2.0.md`



Additional files (if added later) MAY be included in new hash batches.
