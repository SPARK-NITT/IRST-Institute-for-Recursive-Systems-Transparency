# IRST v2.0 — Operational Enforcement-Grade (What It Now Becomes)

## 1. Jurisdiction and Trigger Layer (When IRST Activates)

IRST no longer “exists in theory.” It now activates under defined, auditable triggers:

- Verified CTGS violations  
- Repeated coherence abuse patterns  
- Financial deception chains  
- Algorithmic manipulation evidence  
- False disclosure regimes  

Each trigger now requires:

- evidence class  
- confidence rating  
- independent verification path  
- time-bound review window  

This makes IRST procedural, not ideological.

## 2. Investigation Engine (How Action Happens)

This is where IRST becomes enforceable:

- intake → triage → escalation → resolution pipeline  
- evidence chain-of-custody rules  
- tamper-evident logs  
- multi-party verification requirements  
- blind review lanes for neutrality  

No single authority can:

- initiate,  
- conclude,  
- or publish enforcement alone.

This prevents weaponization.

## 3. Remediation and Sanctions Matrix

Instead of “punishment,” IRST uses graduated remediation:

- disclosure correction mandates  
- algorithmic rebalancing requirements  
- revenue restriction triggers  
- platform audit obligations  
- temporary market participation suspensions  

Sanctions are:

- reversible,  
- appealable,  
- proportional,  
- and publicly reasoned.

## 4. Public Transparency Layer

Every finalized IRST action must publish:

- what was evaluated  
- what failed  
- what was ordered  
- what corrected  
- what remains under monitoring  

This prevents:

- secret lawfare  
- regulatory capture  
- politically invisible punishments

## 5. Interlock with CTGS

CTGS becomes:

- the detector  
- the early warning system  
- the evidentiary substrate  

IRST becomes:

- the response  
- the enforcer  
- the stability restorer  

They now operate as a paired system.
