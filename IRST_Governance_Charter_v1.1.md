# Institute for Recursive Systems Transparency (IRST)

Governance Charter — Version 1.1 (Expanded Edition)  
Author: Spark

## 1. Founding Origin Statement

IRST wasn’t created in a boardroom.

It came from real frustration — the kind you only feel after buying hardware marketed one way,

behaving another, and relying on cloud systems it swore it didn’t need.

Add in the upsell pressure for faster delivery, the hidden limitations, and the recursive support loops…

and suddenly the problem wasn’t the device.

It was the system.

IRST is the answer to that moment — a way to expose these loops before they consume another person’s time and wallet.

## 2. Purpose

The IRST Governance Charter defines the authority, structure, processes, and foundational principles

that guide the development, publication, and management of recursive-systems governance standards.

IRST exists to ensure:

- transparency in systems that generate recursive harms  
- accountability for compounding loops  
- mathematical modeling of failure states  
- public participation in governance  
- long-term structural oversight  

---

## 3. Authority

IRST operates as an independent standards body, deriving authority from:

- its founding documentation and governance structure  
- voluntary public adoption  
- alignment with global transparency norms  
- mathematical modeling rigor  
- precedent established through publication and public participation  

---

## 4. Scope

This charter governs all IRST standards, including but not limited to:

- CTGS (Consumer Transparency Governance Standard)  
- NITT (No-Identity Teleport Theorem)  
- future recursive-systems standards  

It applies to:

- consumer ecosystems  
- digital identity systems  
- AI recommendation loops  
- IoT and cloud-dependent systems  
- recursive, compounding, or fractal harm environments

## 5. Principles

### 5.1 Transparency by Default

Systems must reveal dependencies, limitations, and known failure loops.

### 5.2 Mathematical Framing of Harm

Recursive failures must be modeled, described, and documented using formal methods.

### 5.3 Auditability and Traceability

All behavior must be reproducible, observable, and verifiable.

### 5.4 Disclosure of Hidden Dynamics

Vendors must not conceal compounding behaviors, compatibility limitations, or cloud requirements.

### 5.5 Public Review and Accountability

All standards must undergo open review and iterative refinement.

## 6. Governance Structure

### 6.1 Executive Chair

Holds final ratification authority. Founder: Spark.

### 6.2 Standards Board

Oversees all IRST standards, ensuring alignment with core principles.

### 6.3 Working Groups

Domain-specific teams responsible for drafting and maintaining standards.

### 6.4 Public Review Committee

Manages open commentary and integrates external feedback.

### 6.5 Mathematical Verification Panel

Validates recursive harm models, diagrams, and formal representations.

---

## 8. Document Control and Versioning

All IRST standards must maintain:

- semantic versioning (major.minor.patch)  
- revision logs  
- publication dates  
- editor history  
- annex references  
- mathematical model updates  

---

## 9. Public Participation

IRST encourages public involvement via:

- GitHub issues and pull requests  
- Substack commentary  
- public proposals  
- transparency hearings  
- open mathematical model reviews  

Participation is open to:

- engineers  
- researchers  
- consumers  
- policy makers  
- affected individuals  

---

## 10. Enforcement and Adoption Expectations

While IRST standards are not binding laws,

they establish expectations for:

- ethical corporate behavior  
- transparent AI design  
- truthful device marketing  
- fair consumer treatment  

Future alignment with:

- regulatory bodies  
- consumer protection agencies  
- digital identity frameworks  

is anticipated as adoption grows.

---

## 11. Evolution Clause

As recursive systems expand in complexity, IRST standards will evolve.

This charter allows:

- new standards  
- new annexes  
- new mathematical formalisms  
- restructuring of working groups  
- ratified amendments through the Standards Board
